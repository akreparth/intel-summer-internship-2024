## Title
Introduction to GenAI and Simple LLM Inference on CPU and Fine-tuning of LLM Model to Create a Custom Chatbot

## Description
In this project, I explored the capabilities of Generative AI (GenAI) and Large Language Models (LLMs). The primary focus was on performing inference with LLMs using CPU resources and fine-tuning these models to create a custom chatbot. The internship provided hands-on experience with cutting-edge AI technologies and methodologies, enabling the development of practical and innovative AI solutions.

The project began with a thorough understanding of Generative AI and LLMs, including their applications and use cases. The next step involved performing simple LLM inference tasks using CPU resources, followed by optimizing and evaluating their performance. Subsequently, I learned and applied techniques for fine-tuning pre-trained LLMs to customize them for specific purposes.

The final phase involved integrating the fine-tuned LLM into a chatbot framework. This included designing, developing, and testing the chatbot to ensure it met the desired functionalities. By the end of the internship, I gained valuable insights into Generative AI, practical experience in LLM inference on CPU, and skills in fine-tuning LLMs to create a functional custom chatbot. This project enhanced my technical abilities and prepared me for future roles in AI and machine learning.

## Attached Notebooks
Two Jupyter notebooks have been attached to this repository that document the implementation and experimentation phases of the project.
